# `scaffold-web`

This is a _personal_ project scaffold pushed to GitHub for convenience.

This scaffold sets up a web project based on my maximalist preferences. It uses Yarn, Gulp, ESLint, StyleLint, Pug, PostCSS, Babel, Rollup, TernJS, PureScript, and even a static test server with SSL.

The configurations are unconventional, and are subject to change anytime. So, if you're still reading this, stop!
