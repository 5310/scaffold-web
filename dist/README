The `src` directory is for the actual source files for the project.

Files from this directory will in one way or the other be "compiled" into forms that will can be served statically from the `dist` directory:
- Contents of subdirectories starting WITH an underscore WILL NOT be copied as-is to `dist`.
  - These subdirectories function as simple asset libraries.
- Contents of subdirectories starting WITHOUT any underscore WILL be copied as-is to `dist`.
  - With `index.html` files these subdirectories function as static subpages by default.
- Source files to be specifically compiled will be skipped, bundled, renamed, or otherwise compiled regardless.
