The `_assets` directory is for static assets like SVGs, PNGs, or even gLTF files, etc.

Group these files as they make sense for the given project.

Almost certainly, files under this directory will need to be converted to statically servable forms one way or the other. Please the conversion processes for the respective formats in the `gulpfile`.
